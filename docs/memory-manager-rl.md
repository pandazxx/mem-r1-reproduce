# M4 — GRPO Memory Manager (Stage 1 RL)

Goal: RL-train the Memory Manager — the model that decides `ADD` / `UPDATE` /
`DELETE` / `NOOP` as new dialogue facts arrive — and show the paper's ablation
direction: an RL-trained manager builds banks that answer questions better
than the vanilla (frozen-extraction) banks from M1. Paper reference: removing
the RL manager costs 6.5 F1 (41.0 → 34.5, PPO ablation).

Motivation from M3: 22/81 val questions (27%) have <50% of their gold-answer
tokens anywhere in the top-60 context (mean F1 .136 vs .598 when covered).
That ceiling belongs to memory construction — no Answer Agent training can
fix it.

## The core problem: the reward is an environment

The paper's reward for one memory operation is *downstream QA correctness of
a frozen Answer Agent using the resulting bank*. The paper's own solution
(Algorithm 1, §3.1 / Appendix B.2 of v5) is to precompute the environment
into offline training tuples rather than replay whole conversations: for each
dialogue turn, it builds a *temporal memory-bank snapshot from the previous
50 turns with GPT-4o-mini*, packages it with the turn and any QA pairs linked
to that turn, and stores the tuple. Only three things stay live inside the
verl reward: apply the candidate op, re-run retrieval over the updated bank
(top-30 per participant → 60), and run the frozen Answer Agent (EM reward) —
affordable on their 4×H100s, not on one 32 GB card.

M4 keeps the paper's offline-tuple structure and makes three further
approximations, each stated so M5 (verl) can undo them:

1. **Single-op episodes anchored to QA evidence.** Same shape as the paper's
   tuples: one turn + its linked QA, one operation per rollout, no multi-turn
   credit assignment. The paper doesn't disclose how QAs are "linked to" a
   turn; we use LoCoMo's `QAPair.evidence` dia_ids, the obvious candidate.
   One deviation: our pre-op bank is the *full-conversation* M1 bank, not a
   previous-50-turns snapshot. If UPDATE/DELETE targets prove too diluted,
   entries carry session timestamps, so filtering the bank to "on or before
   the evidence turn's session" cheaply approximates the paper's windowing.
2. **Frozen-bank splicing instead of live retrieval.** The QA's top-60
   context is precomputed from the M1 bank (`artifacts/contexts/train.jsonl`,
   already committed). A candidate op edits that context directly:
   - `ADD` → append the new memory to the context
   - `UPDATE id` → replace that entry's text where it appears in the context
     (append if it wasn't retrieved)
   - `DELETE id` → drop the entry from the context
   - `NOOP` → context unchanged
   No embedding calls at training time; the GPU box stays API-free. This
   approximates "the op changes what retrieval later sees" and is exact
   whenever the affected memory is in (or would enter) the top-60.
3. **Token-F1 reward, not EM.** Direct lesson from M3: EM left 66% of steps
   with zero gradient; the F1-shaped rerun fixed it (+2.4 val F1). We start
   the manager with F1 reward (`reward_metric: f1`), EM available for a
   faithfulness ablation.

## Episode construction (offline, once)

`scripts/build_manager_episodes.py` emits `artifacts/episodes/train.jsonl`,
one record per (train QA × evidence turn):

```json
{"conversation_id": "...", "question": "...", "answer": "...", "category": 4,
 "turn": {"speaker": "...", "text": "...", "date_time": "..."},
 "facts": ["<extracted fact 1>", ...],
 "related": [{"id": "12", "text": "...", "timestamp": "..."}, ...],
 "context": [{"id": "3", "text": "...", "timestamp": "..."}, ...]}
```

- `facts`: NIM re-extraction of the evidence turn (same
  `FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` as M1, so the manager sees M1-style input).
- `related`: top-6 memories most similar to the facts (NIM embeddings) —
  the candidates the manager may `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, with real bank IDs.
- `context`: the QA's top-60 from `artifacts/contexts/train.jsonl`, now
  carrying entry IDs so splicing can match `UPDATE`/`DELETE` targets.

152 train QA × ~2 evidence turns ≈ ~300 episodes; NIM cost $0 (rate-limit
bound, ~30 min). Val episodes built the same way for later analysis.

## Policy and prompt

Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct + LoRA (same r16/α32 recipe as M3 — infra reuse, and the
paper trains both stages on the same backbone). The manager prompt shows the
new facts + the `related` memories (with IDs and timestamps) and asks for a
JSON operation list; `memory_bank.parse_operations` already parses exactly
this (fences, aliases, single-object and list forms). Unparseable output or
an op referencing an unknown ID → reward 0 for that completion (the paper's
outcome-driven spirit: no format shaping beyond validity).

## Reward (the new plumbing)

```
completion → parse_operations → apply to context copy (splice rules above)
          → frozen Answer Agent answers the linked QA on the spliced context
          → reward = token-F1(answer, gold)
```

The frozen Answer Agent is the *same base model* the policy trains on
(Qwen2.5-3B): inside the TRL reward function we generate with the policy's
base weights under `disable_adapter()` — no second model in GPU memory,
greedy decoding, same `ANSWER_PROMPT` as M2/M3. A group of 8 candidate ops
whose spliced contexts differ produces 8 different answers → dense relative
advantage, exactly the mechanism that worked in the F1 rerun.

Baseline subtlety: `NOOP` reproduces the frozen-bank answer, so the manager
is rewarded only for ops that *beat* what the M1 bank already achieves —
the ablation comparison is built into the group baseline.

### Reward v2 (issue #17, after the first A/B)

The v1 reward over-credited `ADD`: it appended the new memory to a context
that already held the top-60, giving it guaranteed visibility that real
retrieval never grants — and the trained policy duly collapsed to ~92% ADD,
grew the banks 1.85×, and *lost* 2 F1 in the real A/B (dilution). Two fixes,
both in `manager.py` and enabled by config:

- **`context_cap: 60`** — the spliced context is capped at top-k size; an
  ADD now *displaces the weakest retrieved memory* instead of extending the
  context, matching what post-op retrieval would actually see.
- **`add_penalty: 0.01`** — a small bank-growth cost per ADD, so ADD must
  beat UPDATE/NOOP by more than a rounding error to be preferred.

## Eval semantics: postprocessor vs true manager (issue #17)

Two distinct rebuild semantics, both supported by
`scripts/rebuild_banks_with_manager.py --mode {edit,construct}`:

- **Postprocessor eval** (`edit`): ops are applied on top of the *completed
  M1 bank*. `NOOP` cannot keep an M1 fact out of memory, and `ADD` stacks
  duplicates onto M1 extraction. This is what the first A/B (2026-07-19)
  measured — it evaluates *M1-plus-manager-edits*, and is favorable to the
  M1 baseline.
- **True-manager eval** (`construct`): the bank starts *empty* and the
  manager is the source of truth — `NOOP` means the fact is never stored;
  `UPDATE`/`DELETE` targets resolve to the constructed entry holding the
  same text (unresolved when the manager never stored it). This is the
  headline M4 comparison going forward.

Raw manager ops are persisted per conversation (`artifacts/manager_ops/`),
so both rebuilds replay offline from one GPU pass, and
`scripts/manager_diagnostics.py` reports op distribution, bank growth,
duplicate rates, top-60 gold coverage, distinct-memory counts, and
per-category F1 for any (banks, contexts, eval) triple.

## Training config

`configs/grpo-manager-qwen3b.yaml`, same shape as M3: 3 epochs, effective
batch 16, 8 generations/prompt, T=0.9, β=0.04, bf16 + gradient checkpointing,
checkpoint every 25 steps + auto-resume. New keys: `episodes:` path,
`answer_max_new_tokens`. Ops are short (~50 tokens) but each reward call adds
8 greedy answer generations (~256 tokens): estimated step time ~60–90 s →
~300 episodes × 3 epochs / 16 ≈ 56 optimizer steps... **≈ 2–4 h ≈ $2–3 on
the 32 GB pod** (`just pod-train configs/grpo-manager-qwen3b.yaml 5h`).

## Eval plan

1. **Cheap proxy (during/after training)**: mean reward vs the NOOP baseline
   on held-out val episodes — did the manager learn ops that beat the frozen
   bank?
2. **Real eval (the M4 result)**: rebuild all 10 banks by replaying every
   conversation turn through the trained manager on the pod (~5.9k turns ×
   1 short generation ≈ 2–3 h ≈ $2), rebuild val contexts (`just contexts`,
   NIM, $0), then the standard A/B on the same CUDA path:
   frozen Answer Agent × {M1 banks, RL-manager banks} — and if positive,
   F1-adapter × RL-manager banks for the full two-stage number.
3. **Coverage stat**: the 27%-unanswerable fraction from M3's analysis should
   drop — that's the mechanism being bought, and it's checkable without any
   model (gold-token coverage of the new contexts).

## Risks

- **Splice approximation**: an ADD that would *not* be retrieved into the
  top-60 at eval time gets training credit it won't cash in. Mitigation: the
  episode's facts come from the QA's own evidence turn, so relevance (and
  hence retrieval) is likely; the bank-rebuild eval measures the true effect.
- **Reward-inside-trainer memory**: policy training + frozen generation on
  one 32 GB card is untested; `disable_adapter()` shares weights so the
  overhead is activation memory only. Fallback: answer-generation batch of 4,
  or a CPU-offloaded answerer (slow), or rent 48 GB.
- **Evidence annotation quality**: some LoCoMo evidence ids may not resolve
  to turns (format drift); episodes with no resolvable evidence are dropped
  and counted in the build log.
- **~56 optimizer steps is few**: if reward is flat, first lever is more
  episodes per QA (all sessions' turns near the evidence, not just evidence
  turns), second is more epochs — both cheap.
